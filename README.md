Justin’s Python Projects Portfolio
Description
Welcome! This repository contains a collection of my beginner and intermediate Python projects. Each folder includes a project focused on practicing a specific skill—such as loops, functions, error handling, data analysis, or automation. My goal is to continuously build new projects and apply what I learn as I transition into a tech career.

Projects Included
-Basic Code Practice
  Simple scripts and mini-exercises as I begin learning Python’s core concepts.
-Number Guessing Game
  A console game where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 10. Features user feedback and looping logic.
See README
